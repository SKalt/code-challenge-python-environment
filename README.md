Run `./scripts/test.sh` to run your tests.
To rerun your tests as you make changes, run `./scripts/test.sh --watch`.

All python files should format themselves using `black` on-save, and should be continually checked by `mypy` (for type checking) and `flake8` (for other common python errors, such as a mistyped keyword argument).
If my configuration didn't stick, you can run any of those commands on the command line.
